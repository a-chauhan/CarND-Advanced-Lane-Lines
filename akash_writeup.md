**Advanced Lane Finding Project**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
* Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
* Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
* Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
* Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
* Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
* Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
* Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

### Camera Calibration

#### 1. Briefly state how you computed the camera matrix and distortion coefficients. Provide an example of a distortion corrected calibration image.

```
def get_objects_images_points(path):
    objects_points = []  
    images_points = []  

    images = glob.glob(path)
    images_count = len(images)

    image_count = 1
    fig = plt.figure()
    for filename in images:
        img = cv2.imread(filename)
        nx, ny = 6, 9
        found, corners = cv2.findChessboardCorners(img, (nx, ny))
        object_points = np.zeros((nx * ny, 3), np.float32)
        object_points[:, :2] = np.mgrid[0: nx, 0: ny].T.reshape(-1, 2)
        
        if not found:
            nx, ny = 5, 9 # Trying with 5 rows
            object_points = np.zeros((nx * ny, 3), np.float32)
            object_points[:, :2] = np.mgrid[0: nx, 0: ny].T.reshape(-1, 2)
            found, corners = cv2.findChessboardCorners(img, (nx, ny))
        
        if found:
            objects_points.append(object_points)
            images_points.append(corners)
    return objects_points, images_points   
``` 

I start by preparing "object points", which will be the (x, y, z) coordinates of the chessboard corners in the world. Here I am assuming the chessboard is fixed on the (x, y) plane at z=0, such that the object points are the same for each calibration image.  Thus, `objp` is just a replicated array of coordinates, and `objpoints` will be appended with a copy of it every time I successfully detect all chessboard corners in a test image.  `imgpoints` will be appended with the (x, y) pixel position of each of the corners in the image plane with each successful chessboard detection.  

I then used the output `objpoints` and `imgpoints` to compute the camera calibration and distortion coefficients using the `cv2.calibrateCamera()` function.  I applied this distortion correction to the test image using the `cv2.undistort()` function and obtained this result:

### Pipeline (single images)

#### 1. Provide an example of a distortion-corrected image.

To demonstrate this step, I will describe how I apply the distortion correction to one of the test images like this one:
![alt text](./img/pipeline_undistorted.png)

#### 2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you used color transforms, gradients or other methods to create a thresholded binary image.  Provide an example of a binary image result.

```
# Define a function to threshold an image for a given range and Sobel kernel
def dir_threshold(img, sobel_kernel=12, thresh=(0.6, np.pi/2)):
    # Grayscale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
    # Calculate the x and y gradients
    sobelx = cv2.Sobel(gray, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=sobel_kernel)
    sobely = cv2.Sobel(gray, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=sobel_kernel)
    # Take the absolute value of the gradient direction, 
    # apply a threshold, and create a binary image result
    absgraddir = np.arctan2(np.absolute(sobely), np.absolute(sobelx))
    binary_output =  np.zeros_like(absgraddir)
    binary_output[(absgraddir >= thresh[0]) & (absgraddir <= thresh[1])] = 1

    # Return the binary image
    return binary_output

# Define a function to return the magnitude of the gradient
# for a given sobel kernel size and threshold values
def mag_thresh(img, sobel_kernel=9, mag_thresh=(30, 255)):
    # Convert to grayscale
    gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY)
    # Take both Sobel x and y gradients
    sobelx = cv2.Sobel(gray, cv2.CV_64F, 1, 0, ksize=sobel_kernel)
    sobely = cv2.Sobel(gray, cv2.CV_64F, 0, 1, ksize=sobel_kernel)
    # Calculate the gradient magnitude
    gradmag = np.sqrt(sobelx**2 + sobely**2)
    # Rescale to 8 bit
    scale_factor = np.max(gradmag)/255 
    gradmag = (gradmag/scale_factor).astype(np.uint8) 
    # Create a binary image of ones where threshold is met, zeros otherwise
    binary_output = np.zeros_like(gradmag)
    binary_output[(gradmag >= mag_thresh[0]) & (gradmag <= mag_thresh[1])] = 1

    # Return the binary image
    return binary_output
```

#### 3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you performed a perspective transform and provide an example of a transformed image.

The code for my perspective transform includes a function called `warper()`, which appears in lines 1 through 8 in the file `example.py` (output_images/examples/example.py) (or, for example, in the 3rd code cell of the IPython notebook).  The `warper()` function takes as inputs an image (`img`), as well as source (`src`) and destination (`dst`) points.  I chose the hardcode the source and destination points in the following manner:

```python
src = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 2) - 55, img_size[1] / 2 + 100],
    [((img_size[0] / 6) - 10), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 5 / 6) + 60, img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] / 2 + 55), img_size[1] / 2 + 100]])
dst = np.float32(
    [[(img_size[0] / 4), 0],
    [(img_size[0] / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), img_size[1]],
    [(img_size[0] * 3 / 4), 0]])
```

This resulted in the following source and destination points:

| Source        | Destination   | 
|:-------------:|:-------------:| 
| 585, 460      | 320, 0        | 
| 203, 720      | 320, 720      |
| 1127, 720     | 960, 720      |
| 695, 460      | 960, 0        |

I verified that my perspective transform was working as expected by drawing the `src` and `dst` points onto a test image and its warped counterpart to verify that the lines appear parallel in the warped image.

#### 4. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you identified lane-line pixels and fit their positions with a polynomial?

Then I did some other stuff and fit my lane lines with a 2nd order polynomial kinda like this:

![alt text](./img/lane_pixels.png)

#### 5. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you calculated the radius of curvature of the lane and the position of the vehicle with respect to center.

```
def measure_curvature_real(ploty, left_fitx, right_fitx):
    '''
    Calculates the curvature of polynomial functions in meters.
    '''
    # Define conversions in x and y from pixels space to meters
    ym_per_pix = 30/720 # meters per pixel in y dimension
    xm_per_pix = 3.7/700 # meters per pixel in x dimension
    
    # Start by generating our fake example data
    # Make sure to feed in your real data instead in your project!
    ploty, left_fit_cr, right_fit_cr = ploty, left_fitx, right_fitx
    
    # Define y-value where we want radius of curvature
    # We'll choose the maximum y-value, corresponding to the bottom of the image
    y_eval = np.max(ploty)
    
    # Calculation of R_curve (radius of curvature)
    left_curverad = ((1 + (2*left_fit_cr[0]*y_eval*ym_per_pix + left_fit_cr[1])**2)**1.5) / np.absolute(2*left_fit_cr[0])
    right_curverad = ((1 + (2*right_fit_cr[0]*y_eval*ym_per_pix + right_fit_cr[1])**2)**1.5) / np.absolute(2*right_fit_cr[0])
    
    return left_curverad, right_curverad
```

#### 6. Provide an example image of your result plotted back down onto the road such that the lane area is identified clearly.

### Pipeline (video)

#### 1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (wobbly lines are ok but no catastrophic failures that would cause the car to drive off the road!).

Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video_output.mp4)

---

### Discussion

#### 1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
